Library of functions as described in [https://joshuanario.com/perfeng.html](https://joshuanario.com/perfeng.html).  There are three modules:
1. `benchmark` - hypothesis testing functions ideal for performance engineering teams that needs benchmark test results with statistical significance
1. `depletion` - algorithm that is useful for detecting depletion states like memory leaks, full disk errors, available IP address exhaustion, etc.
1. `prediction` - residual computation for testing the predictive accuracy of characteristic curves
